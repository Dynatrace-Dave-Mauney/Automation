To tidy up the Templates/Overview dashboards:

NOTE: These steps should generally be handled by the maintainer of the project, not users of the dashboard templates.

The instructions might provide users with ideas for usage of the tools mentioned.

Add the "Return to Overview" link to any new child dashboards!
==============================================================

If adding dashboards:
    Be sure to modify the Overview "More Details" markdown menu with "create_markdown_menus.py" if the dashboards need to be listed there.

If adding Administration dashboards:
    Generate the right version of the Admin dashboard with "generate_administration_dashboard.py".

If adding AWS dashboards:
    Modify the "AWS Home" and generate a new "AWS right side menu" with "generate_aws_home_dashboard_and_markdown_menu.py".
    Open all AWS dashboards except "AWS Home" and replace the right side markdown menu using "change in all open files".

Run "verify_dashboards.py" and review output
Run "clean_dashboards.py"
Run "sort_dashboard_tiles.py"
if either step above said it made any changes:
    Copy the "Templates-Overview-Clean-Sorted" dashboards to the "Templates/Overview" directory
If any dashboards were added or any names or ids were changed:
    Run "create_dashboard_index.py"
    Review "Templates/Overview/dashboard_index_by_id.txt" and "Templates/Overview/dashboard_index_by_name.txt"

PER ENVIRONMENT:
If putting any dashboards with dynamic filters:
    Run "generate_dynamic_tag_filters_yaml.py" for each environment

Run "customize_dashboard_templates.py" (with the env_name, owner, prefix, share and preset values set appropriately)

Run "put_dashboards.py"  (with the environment, owner and prefix values set appropriately)
    Be sure to put the dashboards from the "custom" directory location
    Puts can be done directly from "Templates/Overview" ONLY if no dynamic filter changes are required.
