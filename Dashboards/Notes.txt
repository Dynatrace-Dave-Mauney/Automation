To tidy up the Templates/Overview dashboards:

NOTE: These steps should be handled by the maintainer of the project, not users of the dashboard templates.

The instructions might provide users with ideas for usage of the tools mentioned.

If adding dashboards:
    Be sure to modify the Overview "More Details" markdown menu with "create_markdown_menus.py" if the dashboards need to be listed there.

If adding AWS dashboards:
    Modify the "AWS Home" and generate a new "AWS right side menu" with "generate_aws_home_dashboard_and_markdown_menu.py".
    Open all AWS dashboards except "AWS Home" and replace the right side markdown menu using "change in all open files".

Run verify_dashboards.py and review output
Run clean_dashboards.py
Run sort_dashboard_tiles.py
Copy the clean/sorted dashboards to Templates/Overview directory
Run create_dashboard_index.py
Review Templates/Overview/dashboard_index.txt

If putting any dashboards with dynamic filters:
    Run customize_dashboard_templates.py (with the owner, prefix, share and preset values set appropriately)
    Be sure to put the dashboards from the "custom" directory location

Run put_dashboards.py  (with the environment, owner and prefix values set appropriately)
    Puts can be done directly from Templates/Overview only if no dynamic filter changes are required
