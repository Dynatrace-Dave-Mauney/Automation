## Dashboard Overview Templates

### Overview
The intent of this subproject is to create and publish a Dynatrace Dashboard Framework that can ((optionally) leverage the powerful tags generated by [RobotAdmin](https://github.com/Dynatrace-Dave-Mauney/Automation/tree/main/RobotAdmin#readme).

### The easy way to get started

The easy way to get started is to just leverage the dashboards without modification.  

Just use [put_dashboards.py](https://github.com/Dynatrace-Dave-Mauney/Automation/blob/main/Dashboards/put_dashboards.py) to put all the dashboards in your environment.

Any means that does a "PUT", rather than "POST", is acceptable.  A "PUT" is needed to retain the "fixed ids" that make navigation links consistent.

### Customization

To customize the dashboards, use [dashboard_template_customizer.py](https://github.com/Dynatrace-Dave-Mauney/Automation/blob/main/Dashboards/dashboard_template_customizer.py).

Customization options include the following:

- Modify the owner email address
- Replace the "TEMPLATE: " prefix of the dashboard names
- Control the tags and filters used
- Control the sharing and preset options
- Skip dashboards that are not useful in your environment
