Access all relevant data when managing infrastructure: metrics, logs, vulnerabilities, ...\n**Problem Statement:** When problems happen in the infrastructure its important to quickly have access to all relevant data!\n\n**How Dynatrace helps:** Dynatrace' Host App provides a single point of view for everything needed when managing infrastructure such as hosts (physical, virtual or cloud): Metrics, Logs, Events, Vulnerabilities, Dependencies, Ownership\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Open the [Hosts App](https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.hosts/#newhosts)\n2. Select a host ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_host_selecthost.png)\n3. Expand the timeframe ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_host_host_details_1.png)\n4.

Davis Analyzer can be used for ad-hoc analysis of spikes of CPUs, Disk, Network (or any other metric) and finds the correlating metric\n\n**Steps**\n1. Select a host through the [Hosts App](https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.hosts/#newhosts) 2. Select a host ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/)\n2. Select a metric you want to explore, e.g: System Load\n3. Select a significant enough timeframe that has the pattern in the middle of the data set\n4. Once the Analyze button becomes available select the metric ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_host_davisondemand_selecttime.png)\n5.
