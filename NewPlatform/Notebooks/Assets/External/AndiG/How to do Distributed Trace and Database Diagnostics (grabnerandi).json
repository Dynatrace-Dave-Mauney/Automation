Open the [Distributed Traces App](https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.distributed.traces/ui/diagnostictools/purepaths)\n2. Add and sort by database columns ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_trace_database.png)\n3. Use filter to find outliers top contributors ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_trace_databasefilter.png)\n4.

Detecting inefficient  database queries (SQL, NoSQL, ...), root cause and impact\n**Problem Statement:** Database performance problems can either be caused by inefficient queries or because services are making too many inefficient calls. \n\n**How Dynatrace helps:** Dynatrace identifies the top inefficient queries and inefficient query patterns (N+1 Query, too much data queried, ...). Dynatrace does this by analyzing distributed traces (captured through OneAgent or ingested through OpenTelemetry). This makes it easy to optimize the queries or the code that executes queries inefficiently!\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Open the [Database App](https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.databases/ui/databases)\n2. Click [Top database statements](https://wkf10640.live.dynatrace.com/ui/diagnostictools/mda?gtf=-2h&gf=all&mdaId=topdb) to analyze across all databases ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_database_opentopstatements.png)\n3. Analyze by call frequency, response time, fetch count or errors! ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_database_topdbanalysis.png)\n4. Open the backtrace to identify where those calls come from! ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_database_dbbacktrace.png)"
