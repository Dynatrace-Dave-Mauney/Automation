            "markdown": "# Step 1: Install Dynatrace Operator for K8s Observability & Security\nThe preferred way to get observability into your K8s cluster is by deploying the Dynatrace Operator. The operator gives you full Kubernetes observability including ingestion of Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Logs and it will also cover K8s and Application Security.\nIf you don't want to install the Operator you can also leverage our ingest options for OpenTelemetry (Logs, Metrics and Traces). To learn more about this please see: [Ingesting OpenTelemetry Data with Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/extend-dynatrace/opentelemetry/getting-started)\n\nFor the operator its easiest to follow the following steps\n1. Open the [Kubernetes App](https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.kubernetes/ui/kubernetes)\n2. Follow the Quick Start steps to [Connect automatically via Dynatrace Operator](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-k8s/quickstart)\n3. Once the Dynatrace Operator is installed you will see your metrics, logs, events, traces, vulnerabilities ... in the Dynatrace Kubernetes screens. \n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_platform_k8s_connect.png)\n\n## Best Practices on Meta Data for K8s\nThe Dynatrace Operator is configured through DynaKube CRD which allows you to configure different types of behaviors. Please have a look at these topics:\n* [Automated Build Label Propagation (Version Detection)](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-k8s/guides/metadata-automation/build-label-propagation)\n* [Metadata metric enrichment](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-k8s/guides/metadata-automation/metadata-metric-enrichment)\n---"

Leverage the automatic Prometheus scraping as described in [Monitor Prometheus metrics](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform-modules/infrastructure-monitoring/container-platform-monitoring/kubernetes-monitoring/monitor-prometheus-metrics).\n2. Enable Anomaly detection based on [Alert on common Kubernetes issues](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform-modules/infrastructure-monitoring/container-platform-monitoring/kubernetes-monitoring/alert-on-kubernetes-issues)"
