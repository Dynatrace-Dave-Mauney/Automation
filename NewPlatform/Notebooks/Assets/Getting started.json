You're in the right place.\nIf you're already familiar with Notebooks, you can get going with an\u202fempty notebook. \nIf you ever want to revisit this page, you\u2019ll find it under Getting started in the (?) menu.\n\n### With Notebooks, you can:\n* Query, analyze, and visualize all your observability data, including logs, metrics, and events powered by [Grail](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/dynatrace-grail)\ufeff.\n* Create and collaborate on interactive, data-driven, and persistent documents.\n* Fetch and incorporate external data with [ad-hoc functions](https://dt-url.net/functions-help). \n* Add markdown to provide context and bring colleagues along.\n\nIn each notebook, you can add sections of **Query**, **Code**, and **Markdown**. On this page, we show you how to work with each one. "
